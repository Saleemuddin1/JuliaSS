These are C files which perform Ceaser Cipher encryptionn, decrpytion, and count the occurences of each character in a text file. File countKey.c counts the number of occurences of each character in ceaser1.txt. Then, file encrypt.c encrypts the contents in message1.txt using a Ceaser cipher algorithm. It stores the outputted encrypted text file in output.txt. Then, file decrypt.c decrypts file contents of ceaser2.txt.
